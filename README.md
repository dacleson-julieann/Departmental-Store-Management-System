# Departmental-Store Management System

This application is not GUI based application.
This is an Application which allows the users to make a purchase from the list of the products currently 
available in the departmental store. 
It also manages the record of the products and the purchase history.

I have made use of basics of C++, OOPS using C++ and File Handling using C++ which handles all files.

There is a passwd.dat file which manages the login credentials.

Once the application runs, it will ask for login credentials. 
One individual is the administrator of the store.
And rest are the users.

The administrator manages the addition of the new products in the record. 
He can also modify the product details and delete some products from the record.

The user while purchasing a product first go through the products available 
and based on that he makes choice of what product is needed to be bought.
After successful selection, he will be given the bill of his purchase based 
on the discount provided on that particular product.
